Arquette and Piazza offer emotionally powerful performances set against the backdrop of addiction and greed.

The Wannabe is a stunning look at the pursuit of power.","release_date":"2015-12-04","poster_path":"/lNdcophK33wjayTRTfbHORj54H9.jpg","popularity":3.511695,"title":"The Wannabe","video":false,"vote_average":2.3,"vote_count":3},{"adult":false,"backdrop_path":"/cnNuW5KoXhNCzx90iaiJ90zgcSq.jpg","genre_ids":[80],"id":368342,"original_language":"de","original_title":"Mordkommission Berlin 1","overview":"A crime movie directed by Marvin Kren.","release_date":"2015-12-01","poster_path":"/5d4IlHyGOanCON26yUyWlHi7nTP.jpg","popularity":3.505999,"title":"Mordkommission Berlin 1","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0},{"adult":false,"backdrop_path":"/Ah6rSyVWRQWhSr6sRbdzMIlnzuf.jpg","genre_ids":[27,10749,35],"id":323694,"original_language":"en","original_title":"Nina Forever","overview":"Holly loves Rob and tries to help him through his grief – even if it means contending with his dead girlfriend Nina, who comes back, bloody and broken, every time they make love","release_date":"2015-12-01","poster_path":"/nswYufoclu1tka560j7hZbrSVmv.jpg","popularity":3.472097,"title":"Nina Forever","video":false,"vote_average":4.7,"vote_count":3},{"adult":false,"backdrop_path":"/53vTUTm3EBH4GNz71sIEh94kGRg.jpg","genre_ids":[35],"id":296100,"original_language":"en","original_title":"The Night Before","overview":"In New York City for their annual tradition of Christmas Eve debauchery, three lifelong best friends set out to find the Holy Grail of Christmas parties since their yearly reunion might be coming to an end.","release_date":"2015-11-25","poster_path":"/eEGZgNZgN3sZWwoSaL1u2rTGlzj.jpg","popularity":2.356575,"title":"The Night Before","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":37}],"total_pages":39,"total_results":772}
